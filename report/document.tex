\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}
One-two sentences on what is the problem that you addressing. Two-three sentences
that contain a high-level description on how you address the problem (your method). 2-3 sentences
on the results. 1 sentence on what the advance that has been achieved with this work
can influence the field (what it will enable, for the specific field and whole area in general)

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
1-2 sentences of the general area, 1-2 sentences on the specific sub-area. A paragraph
on the specific problem and how it has been addressed so far. 1-2 sentences to a paragraph
on what is missing on current approaches and why this is important.
Then a paragraph on what this paper contributes - how you approach this problem and the
results of the approach - This paragraph should have \textbf{\textit{clear}}, \textbf{\textit{definite}} \textbf{\textit{claims}} on what you have
achieved in relation to what you claimed that is missing in the field (from the previous paragraph).
You should not add items that do not relate to the previous "missing/desired" advances
that you introduced before. If this happens, then either you have not introduced the challenges/missing/desired
in the previous paragraph adequately, or your claim is irrelevant to this
paper and has to be removed.
Some people include a last paragraph with the structure of the paper as the closing introduction
paragraph. This is up to you.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
 Divide it into sections that are well-defined on the distinct components/algorithms/subproblems.
 Put references whenever you use/step on previously published work. Use sub-section
 indexing (3.1, 3.2, etc.). Describe fully your algorithms and methods, so that if anyone wants to
 reproduce your results can do so (sometimes this is difficult if there are many parameters, in
 which case a parameter file should be included as suppl. mat.).

\subsection{Clustering}
\label{subsec:kMeans}
We took two different approaches to clustering our data: k-means and hierarchical. We looked at k-means to try and see if there had any obvious patterns and then see if those patterns held any significance for genre or song hotness. Hierarchical gave us insight to the distribution of our data and helped us select the appropriate number of clusters for k-means. For both approaches we chose to use MATLAB and take advantage of the built-in clustering methods.
\\ \\
Initially we chose to look at the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item danceability
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item duration
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item end of fade in
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item energy
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item key
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item loudness
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item mode
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item song hotness
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item start of fade out
\vspace{-3.5mm} 
\item tempo
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item time signature
\vspace{-3.5mm}
\item year
\end{itemize}

We ran these through the MATLAB k-means function and viewed the clusters of all these features plotted against song hotness. We heard that the general rule of thumb was to run k-means on the sqrt(n/2) clusters. However we found that this did not produce distinct clusters and was very muddy. We found four clusters were the most distinct visually, but we did not check if it maximized the variance.

We found that the clusters seemed to be skewed by issues with our data set. We noticed that danceability and energy where all 0 in the provided dataset (the value was supposed to range between 0 and 1). Therefore we decided to throw out those two columns. We also threw out year and mode because the ended up being nearly categorical in that their normalized values were almost 0 or almost 1. Another issue we noticed is that some of the song hotness values where either 0 or NaN so we removed datapoints where this was the case. After removing these features and datapoints from the dataset we found we got better clusters.

To get the hierarchical clusters and plot the dendrogram we used the MATLAB functions dendrogram and linkage. The linkage function returns a tree of when to clusters are linked together. We decided to view the dendrogram with at most 50 distinct clusters. We found that there were really 4 distinct leaves. After the 4 initial splits the splits didn't look any more significant than when we plotted a dendrogram for random data.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This should only describe the results that you have obtained. Sometimes it make sense
to discuss your guess/opinion why this is happening, but this should be rare. This section is to
only present the facts about the method performance, robustness, complexity, etc.

This is where you discuss everything that was presented in the Results section.
Why did the algorithm perform better in X and not in Y. It is ok to succinctly re-state strong
result claims (that were included in the previous section), as long as you continue to explain,
even speculate why this may be the case. For example: "Our algorithm was faster in X\% of the
scenarios than what is currently available. The main drive behind this performance boost is the
Y module, which takes advantage of the Z characteristic of the problem. Indeed, ...."

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Finally, in what some papers refer to as "Conclusion", you provide 1-2 sentences of the purpose
of this report and 1-2 sentences of what was achieved (these 2-4 sentences are usually similar
or re-stating what was said in the abstract). Then you go on to discuss about what remains to
be done (the road ahead), why (the impact to the field) and how you think it can be achieved
(future work). You end the report with 1-2 sentences on how the work presented advances the
field in the grant scheme of things.

\section{References}
\label{sec:references}
 Please include all relevant references for the paper, to provide a succinct and accurate
 summary of past work and challenges in the field. Research has found that the more
 2
 articles you cite, the more you will be cited too. For this report you are expected to have 10-20
 references.
