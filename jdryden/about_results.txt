overfitting.jpeg is included in case we want to show an example of overfitted regression. Without including song tags,there is a clear shape that the regression tries to fit, and it is exaggerated greatly using PCA.

MSE results:

with song tags										0.0433
with song tags/zero values removed					0.0223
with only the top 5 tags/zero values removed		0.0234

without tags										0.0471
without tags/using PCA								0.0488
no tags/zero values removed							0.0241
